Trying out [netlify functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/)

### Using Serverless Functions for form submissions

- Run `yarn server` to use Netlify dev
- Redirecting the api using `netlify.toml`
- Using react `useReducer` hook to manage the state
- Create a serverless function
- Use the serverless function to send email from the form (using additional tooling we could do this; Currently things just get logged in the console)

Fun things learned:

- Using `hub` rather than git for additional functionality
- Alias `git status -sb` for better status logs
- Using `componentName.module.css` for styling
